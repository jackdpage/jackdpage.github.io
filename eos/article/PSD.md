## PSD

The PSD (or Playback Status Display) displays the Cues in a selected Cue List.
The displayed Cue List will change dependent on the currently active Cue.
Alternatively, the displayed Cue List can be locked in the tab settings menu.

Pressing **[Format]** will cycle through the three layouts available within the
PSD tab. The default is to show a single Cue List and (optionally) one Fader
Bank. Pressing **[Format]** once will display two Cue Lists and (optionally)
one Fader Bank. Pressing **[Format]** again will display one Cue List and ten
Fader Banks.

### Settings

- _Target Grid_: When two Cue Lists are being displayed, determines which of
the two is affected by the _Lock Status_ setting.
- _Lock Status_: Locks the tab to display the chosen Cue List, or unlocks so
the displayed Cue List dynamically changes dependent on the active Cue.

a single line.

graphically.
- _Display Scenes_: When selected, sectioning graphics will be shown where

the status of the Cue List mapped to the Master Fader.

bottom of the tab. Does not affect the display when ten Fader Banks are being
displayed.
- _Display Notes_: When selected shows a box at the bottom of the tab
containing Notes for the currently active Cue.
- _Break Link to Live/Blind_:
- _Reorder Columns_: Determines which columns are displayed and in which order
they appear.

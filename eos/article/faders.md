## Faders

A Fader is an assignable control consisting of a linear fader and three
buttons. Faders in Eos are arranged in banks of ten. Faders can be either
physical or virtual. A virtual fader bank can be accessed using the Fader
Module tab (28).

Any bank of faders, physical or virtual, can be paged through 100 pages of
faders using the paging buttons. This gives a total of 1000 faders available.

Faders can be assigned in the Fader Config tab (36) or the Fader List tab (35).
Alternatively, they can be assigned by selecting the content to be assigned to
the fader then pressing the Load button above the fader.

Types of content that can be loaded onto faders are:

- Cue Lists
- Submasters
- Palettes (of all four types)
- Presets

Additionally, a fader can take a special type of:

- Grand Master
- Manual Time master

### Fader Options

#### Exclude

When selected, the contents of the fader will be excluded from the the
function. For example, selecting GM will result in the Grandmaster not
affecting the contents of the fader.
